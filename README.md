## Scenario
Paradigm Pet Professionals needs to redesign its website with the goal of having 100,000 new visitors and 150 new consults within the next year. They provided a design brief, user personas, old website files, website copy, and their new logo. 

# Process
## Needs & Solutions Analysis
My first step was to review the current website and do a user and stakeholder needs analysis. 

I figured out how I would solve their needs using the three (3) design areas of content, functionality, and navigation. 
| Design Areas  | Unmet User Needs | User Needs Solutions | Unmet Stakeholder Needs | Stakeholder Needs Solutions |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |
| Content  | **Users need recommendations about pet toys that encourage physical activity**, and the “Dogs” page doesn’t have any information on dog toys.  | I will include information on the “Dogs” page about dog toys.  | **Stakeholders need users to trust the company for information to encourage users to contact them for consultations** but there is no legitimizing information or credentials about the company on any pages.   | I will include the company’s experience and credentials on their “About” page.   |
| Functionality  | **Users need to easily navigate on various mobile devices and desktops**, but the website does not have a responsive design to accommodate multiple viewport sizes.  | I will redevelop the website with responsive layouts.  | **Stakeholders need to gather information from their users to be able to properly reply to their consultation requests**, but there is no contact or survey form for users to fill out and submit.  | I will create a consultation request form on a dedicated “Contact Us” page.  |
| Navigation  | **Users need a predictable way of finding their way around the site**, but the navigation bar does not have consistent formatting, structure, or hyperlinks. (E.g., the FAQs page does not have a functional home link and the Dogs and Cats link positions are switched.)  | I will design a navigation bar that is consistent, with no dead links, and provides feedback on which page the user is currently on.  | **Stakeholders need to have a high SEO ranking to bring in more organic web traffic and meet their site goal of 100,000 new visitors within one year**, but their title and meta-tags information are not using keywords that search engines use.  | I will ensure the title and meta tags include their desired keywords “new pet consultation” and “new pet care consultation”.  |

I ended up with the following list:
- Make the website responsive
- Build trust by adding the company’s credentials and experience on the “About” page
- Build a “Contact Us” page with a form whose contents are sent to the company
- Develop an SEO plan including the keywords “new pet consultation” and “new pet care consultation” etc.
- Redesign the navigation to provide page indicators and ensure no deadlinks.

## Site mapping
One of the main pain points was to improve the site’s navigation. 
1. To start this process I designed the site map that I would be using to base my wireframe on. 
2. I ensured there was an “About Page” and a “Contact Us” page because that was identified as a core need. 
3. I then created a hierarchy to group company information, pet care information, outgoing links to adoption sites, and a Call to Action (CTA) which will be a part of the core navigation bar.
 
## Wireframing
Using the site map as a guide, I began designing the wireframes starting from the top (Home) and going down to the subpages. I used Figma to create the following high-definition wireframes.

## Prototype
Finally, I used the high-definition wireframes to produce a prototype using InVision in order to demonstrate the site's functionality.
