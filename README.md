## Scenario
Paradigm Pet Professionals needs to redesign its website with the goal of having 100,000 new visitors and 150 new consults within the next year. They provided a design brief, user personas, old website files, website copy, and their new logo. 

# Process
## Needs & Solutions Analysis
My first step was to review the current website and do a user and stakeholder needs analysis. 

I figured out how I would solve their needs using the three (3) design areas of content, functionality, and navigation. 

I ended up with the following list:
- Make the website responsive
- Build trust by adding the company’s credentials and experience on the “About” page
- Build a “Contact Us” page with a form whose contents are sent to the company
- Develop an SEO plan including the keywords “new pet consultation” and “new pet care consultation” etc.
- Redesign the navigation to provide page indicators and ensure no deadlinks.

## Site mapping
One of the main pain points was to improve the site’s navigation. 
1. To start this process I designed the site map that I would be using to base my wireframe on. 
2. I ensured there was an “About Page” and a “Contact Us” page because that was identified as a core need. 
3. I then created a hierarchy to group company information, pet care information, outgoing links to adoption sites, and a Call to Action (CTA) which will be a part of the core navigation bar.
 
## Wireframing
Using the site map as a guide, I began designing the wireframes starting from the top (Home) and going down to the subpages. I used Figma to create the following high-definition wireframes.

## Prototype
Finally, I used the high-definition wireframes to produce a prototype using InVision in order to demonstrate the site's functionality.
